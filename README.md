# Team-Profile-Generator
This is a command line application that enables users to create cards for each member on a team. It allows the user to see all of the team members' information at a glance. 

When the user inputs `node app.js` into the command line, user will be prompted to answer the questions regarding the team members. The info will then be rendered onto clean cut cards on a web browser. 

User will be able to add multiple members and easily access each member's information as desired.
